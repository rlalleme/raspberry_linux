This file describe the process to create a custom Linux
-------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this part is to turn the downloaded raspbian into a partition system
usable for the next steps.



Requirements
------------
-A computer with Linux (called COMP from now on)
-A raspberry and an SD card with at least 4Go (called respectively RASP
 and SD)
-Download the raspbian, it will serve as a model: 
 https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
 At the time of the writing: 2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.zip
 (Remember to check the SHA-1)



Foreword
--------
Reminder:
$ command to be run by the user (defaut: pi)
# command to be run by root

The first step takes place on COMP with the SD plugged in.
So determine which device is attached to it
# fdisk -l
This device will be referred as /dev/<sd>



Create a correct volume
-----------------------
First create the appropriate partitions
For instance to have a 100M partition for the boot and a 3.8G for the system
# fdisk /dev/<sd>
o<Enter>	#to erase everything
n<Enter>	#then create a new primary partition
<Enter>		#Chooses the type primary
<Enter>		#Sets the partition number to 1
<Enter>		#Places the first sector to the default value
+100M<Enter>	#Create a 100M partition

Then
n<Enter>	#Create a new partition again
<Enter>		#Chooses the type primary
<Enter>		#Sets the partition number to 2
<Enter>		#Places the first sector to the default value
8194047<Enter>	#to create a 3.8G partition (3.8 * 1024 * 1024 * 2 - 1 + 206848)
					block size to sector ----^   ^      ^
						       0-indexed ----|      |
				      index of the last previous sector ----|

Then change the type of the first partition to VFAT
t<Enter>	#Change the type
1<Enter>	#Select the first partition
c<Enter>	#Choose VFAT format

Finish the partitioning
w<Enter>		#Write the changes to the SD



Copy the content from the raspbian to the new volume
----------------------------------------------------
Now set the filesystem and mount the partitions, the two partitions created
before are referred as '/dev/<part1>' and '/dev/<part2>'
# mkfs.vfat /dev/<part1>
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/<part2>
# mkdir root boot
# mount /dev/<part1> boot
# mount /dev/<part2> root

Then mount the debian image (the model) first unzip it.
# unzip <raspbian>.zip

To do so first determine the "offset" :
# parted <raspbian_image>.img
u	#Ask to change the unit
B	#Unit is block
p	#Print the values
Look at the column "Start" and note down the value for both partitions
In this example we assume: 4194304 and 62914560
q	#Quit parted

Now mount them
# mkdir root-model boot-model
# mount -t vfat -o loop,offset=<4194304> <linux_image>.img boot-model
# mount -o loop,offset=<62914560> <linux_image>.img root-model

Then copy the content from the model to the new one
# cp -r -p boot-model/* boot/.
# cp -r -p root-model/* root/.

To finish unmount the partitions and unplug the SD
# umount root boot root-model boot-model



Next step
---------
Now start RASP with the linux from SD and now it is possible to move on the next
step, follow the steps from '02_installation_ros_debian'

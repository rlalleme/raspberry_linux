How to properly use the brand new Linux
---------------------------------------

This file describes how to operate the new image.



Requirements
------------
-A computer with Linux (called COMP from now on)
-The raspberry (called RASP), and an SD to copy the image into (or the SD from
	the last step '03_create_image').



Use the image to prepare a new SD card
--------------------------------------
Copy the image to the SD
$ sudo dd if=<output_file>.img of=/dev/<SD_device> bs=1M



Logins
------
Two logins:
pi	raspberry
root	root



After first boot
----------------
To use the new Linux to its full extent (from COMP)
$ ssh pi@<raspberry_pi>

Once connected, you can extend the filesystem to fill the SD card to its maximum
$ sudo raspi-config



Change the keyboard
-------------------
Add keyboard support, call
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
Change the keyboard using the prompt

$ sudo service keyboard-setup restart



Note on ROS
-----------
ROS in decomposed of two parts:
* The distribution, located in /opt/ros-src. To add new ROS functionnalities you
	need to (as root) add them and compile them. The tools are then
	installed on /opt/ros/indigo/. (Note: this path is added by default in
	the environment of 'pi' user.)
* A user workspace is created in ~/ros, for the user 'pi' (and for 'root').



WiringPi
--------
WiringPi has been installed at system level, you can find it and use it in most
build system. For instance it is possible to use it in CMake:
find_package(wiringPi REQUIRED)
include_directories(${wiringPi_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_link_libraries(<target> ${wiringPi_LIBRARIES})

Or in a Makefile:
<target>:
	g++ <file> -o <target> -lwiringPi

Logins
------

Two logins:
pi	raspberry
root	root


After first boot
----------------

To use the new Linux to its full extent
$ ssh pi@<raspberry_pi>
On the raspberry
$ sudo raspi-config
Use the function "Extend the filesystem", to fill the SD card to its maximum


General informations
--------------------

The following softwares are pre-installed:
gcc,g++	- C and C++ compilers
ROS	- A middleware for component-based developpment, provides many basic modules
CMake	- Cross-Platform Makefile Generator, project manger
Git	- Distributed revision control system (a bit like SVN, a lot better in fact)
Boost	- A multi-purpose, very efficient, set of C++ libraries
Vim,Nano- In terminal editors

Note on ROS:
ROS in decomposed in two parts:
- The distribution, located in /opt/ros-src. Once compiled in produces the ros tools.
	The tools are then installed on /opt/ros/indigo/.
	This path is added by default in the environment of 'pi' user
- A user workspace is created in ~/ros, for the user 'pi'.


Examples
--------

Some demo codes are provided:
~/hello_world: the "hello world" in C++ using Makefile to compile

~/ros/src/hello_publisher  \_ Demo codes for ROS (publisher and subscriber, from the ROS tutorial)
~/ros/src/hello_subscriber /
